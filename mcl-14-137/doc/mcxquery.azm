\sec{description}{DESCRIPTION}
\par{
   The default \mcxquery output is a list of summary statistics for each
   node. These are its node degree, the mean, minimum, maximum and median
   edge weight. If supplied with a clustering, the output will additionally
   list the cluster size and cluster label for each node.
   }

\par{
   Additionally, \mcxquery can be used to analyse a graph at different similarity
   cutoffs or at varying parameters of edge reduction strategies such as mutual
   nearest neighbour reduction.

   Attributes supplied across different thresholds are the number of connected
   components, the number of singletons, and statistics (median, average, iqr)
   on node degrees and edge weights.

   Typically this is done on a graph constructed using a very permissive
   threshold. For example, one can create a graph from array expression data
   using \mcxarray with a very low pearson correlation cutoff such as\~0.5
   Then \mcxquery can be used to analyze the graph at increasingly
   stringent thresholds of\~0.50, 0.55, 0.60\~..\~0.95.
}


\par{Other tasks that \mcxquery be used for include:
   }

\begin{itemize}{{flow}{compact}}
\item
   Produce a histogram of edge weights.
\item
   Produce a histogram of edge node degrees.
\item
   Output all edge weights.
\item
   Test whether the graph weight encodes a metric
   (for edge weights that encode distances rather than similarites).
\item
   Test whether the graph has a cycle.
\end{itemize}

\""{
   and a graph plotting the R^2 value of the relationship of log(k)
   versus the logarithm of the number of nodes of degree at least k (for the
   graph at a given threshold).

   Scale-free networks are defined by having a high R^2 value.  It should
   be noted however that in many applications graphs will not be scale-free.
   Additionally, for the purpose of clustering scale-free networks are to be
   avoided or transformed, as the highly-connected nodes in scale-free networks
   obfuscate cluster structure.
}

\sec{options}{OPTIONS}

\begin{itemize}{\mcx_itemopts}

\item{\defopt{-abc}{<fname>}{label input}}
\car{
   The file name for input that is in label format.}

\item{\defopt{-imx}{<fname>}{input matrix}}
\car{
   The file name for input that is in mcl native matrix format.
   }

\item{\defopt{-o}{<fname>}{output file name}}
\car{
   Set the name of the file where output should be written to.
   }

\item{\defopt{-tab}{<fname>}{use tab file}}
\car{
   This option causes the output to be printed with the labels
   found in the tab file.
   }
\:  With \genopt{-abc} this option will, additionally, construct
\:  a graph only on the labels found in the tab file.
\:  If this option is used in conjunction with \genopt{-imx} the
\:  tab domain and the matrix domain are required to be identical.


\item{\defopt{--dim}{report native format and dimensions}}
\car{
   This will report the matrix format (either interchange or binary)
   and the matrix dimensions. For a graph the two reported dimensions
   should be equal.
   }


\items{
   {\defopt{--values}{output all entries/weights, unsorted}}
   {\defopt{--values-sorted}{output all entries/weights, sorted}}
   {\defopt{-values-hist}{<start/end/nbins>}{output weight histogram}}
   {\defopt{-values-hist}{<nbins>}{output weight histogram}}
   {\defopt{-degrees-hist}{<nbins>}{degrees histogram}}
}
\car{
   These options are fairly self-documenting. The result of both
   \genopt{-edges-hist} and \genopt{-degrees-hist}
   is a tab separated table of bin offsets and bin counts.
   When using \genopt{-edges-hist}{<nbins>} the program will
   create a histogram ranging from the smallest to
   the largest edge weight.
   }

\item{\defopt{--output-table}{output logical tab separated table without key}}
\car{
   This option causes table output such as provided by \genopt{--vary-correlation}
   to be output in a logical tab-separated format rather than pretty-printed.
   }

\item{\defopt{-vary-threshold}{<start/end/nbins>}{analyze graphs at similarity cutoffs}}
\car{
   The graph is analysed at different edge weight thresholds, going from \genopt{<start>}
   to \genopt{<end>} in \genopt{<nbins>} steps.
   }

\item{\defopt{--vary-correlation}{analyze graphs at correlation cutoffs}}
\car{
   This instructs \mcxquery to use a threshold list suitable for use with graphs
   in which the edge weight similarities are correlations.
   The list starts at 0.2 and ends at 1.0 using increments of 0.05.
   If a different start or increment is required it can
   be achieved by using the \genopt{-vary-threshold} option.
   For example, a start of\~0.10 and an increment of\~0.02 are obtained
   by issuing \useopt{-vary-threshold}{:.1/1.0/45}.
   }

\item{defopt{--no-legend}{do not output explanatory legend}}
\car{
   For a fully parseable output format use \genoptref{--output-table}.
   }


\items{
   {\defopt{--clcf}{include clustering coefficient analysis}}
   {\defopt{--eff}{include efficiency criterion}}
}
\car{
   These options can be used to compute additional characteristics
   in the analysis of thresholded graphs with \genopt{--vary-correlation}
   and \genopt{-vary-threshold}. For large graphs these are relatively time-consuming
   to compute. More information and a reference for
   the efficiency criterion can be found in \mysib{clminfo}.
   }

\items{
   {\defopt{-vary-knn}{<start/end/step>}{analyze graphs for varying k-NN}}
\:   {\hiddenopt{-vary-n}{<start/end/step>}{analyze graphs for varying N}}
   {\defopt{-vary-ceil}{<start/end/step>}{analyze graphs for varying ceil reductions}}
   {\defopt{--reduce}{use reduced matrix}}
}
\car{
   These options cause analysis of a graph as it is subjected to reductions
   across a range of parameters. Refer to \mysib{mcxio} for a description of
   these reductions.  The analyses starts at the \it{end} argument, and
   progresses towards the \it{start} argument using decrements of size
   \it{step}.  By default the reduction is always computed relative to the
   start matrix, i.e. the input matrix after \genopt{-tf} transformations have
   optionally been applied. Specifying \genopt{--reduce} causes this to change
   so that each new reduction is calculated relative to the reduction just
   computed.
   }

\par{
   For graphs with ties among edge weights it may be useful to use
   \useopt{-tf}{'#tug()'}. This will add small perturbations to the
   edge weights and have the effect of breaking ties.
   By default perturbations are computed using the cosine between
   the vectors of neighbours of the two nodes incident to an edge.
   This can be changed to a random perturbation with
   \useopt{-tf}{'#rug()'}.
   }

\items{
   {\defopt{--test-cycle}{test whether graph contains cycles}}
   {\defopt{-test-cycle}{<num>}{test cycles, report cyclees}}
}
\car{
   Test whether the input graph contains cycles. With the second option
   nodes that are part of a cycle are output, up to a maximum of \genarg{<num>}
   nodes. Use \genarg{<num>}=\usearg{-1} to output all such nodes.
   }

\item{\defopt{--test-metric}{test whether graph distance is metric}}
\car{
   This tests all possible triangle relationships.
   }

\""{
\item{\kefopt{-digits}{<num>}{width of fractional part}}
\car{
   In the output graph and table, the thresholds are by default
   printed with two digits for the fractional part. This
   can be changed using this option.

   }}


\item{\defopt{-div}{<num>}{cluster size separating value}}
\car{
   When analyzing graphs at different thresholds with one of the
   options above, \mcxquery reports the percentage of nodes contained
   in clusters not exceeding a specified size, by default\~3.
   This number can be changed using the \genopt{-div} option.
   }


\shared_itemopt{-tf}
\car{\shared_defopt{-tf}}


\item{\defopt{-t}{<num>}{number of threads to use}}
\car{
   This has an effect only when using the \genopt{-vary-knn} option,
   and is only useful on multi-CPU machines.
   }


\item{\defopt{--node-attr}{output node degree and weight attributes}}
\car{
   Output is in the form of a tab separated file.
   The option \genopt{-icl} can be used in conjuction.
   }


\item{\defopt{-icl}{<fname>}{input clustering}}
\car{
   Output for each node the size of the cluster it is in.
   This option can be used in conjunction with \genopt{--node-attr}.
   }
